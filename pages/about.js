                        I&rsquo;m a principal software engineer working in scientific publishing. I
                        find joy in having a breadth of knowledge across the stack and I really
                        really enjoy mentoring engineers and clearing roadblocks.

                    <p>
                        I live in Raleigh, North Carolina and have spent most of my life here, but I
                        grew up in India, Somalia, and Kenya. I have a Bachelor&rsquo;s degree in
                        Computer Engineering from Iowa State University.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I enjoy running, biking, disc golf, reading, food, dadding, growing plants,
                        and I have backyard chickens. I&rsquo;ve also recently started playing
                        violin.

                    <p>
                        I am also an indie maker. You can see my projects{' '}
