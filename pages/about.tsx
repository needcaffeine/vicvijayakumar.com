                        I&rsquo;m a software engineer currently working on frontend tooling,
                        architecture, and infrastructure. Previously, I found joy in building
                        solutions to accelerate the dissemination of scientific research. I enjoy
                        having a breadth of knowledge across the stack and I really really enjoy
                        mentoring engineers, clearing roadblocks, and making things fast.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I live in Raleigh, North Carolina and have spent most of my life here, but I
                        grew up in India, Somalia, and Kenya. I have a Bachelor&rsquo;s degree in
                        Computer Engineering from Iowa State University.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I enjoy running, biking, disc golf, reading, writing, food, dadding, growing
                        plants, playing with dough, and I have backyard chickens. I am also recently
                        a violinist, and I enjoy playing music.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I am also a part-time indie maker. You can see my projects{' '}
