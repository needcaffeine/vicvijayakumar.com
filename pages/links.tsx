                            - Building tech for social good with low-code tools with Vic Vijayakumar
                            - When Vic Vijayakumar saw his daughterâ€™s preschool struggling with an
                            inefficient and non-digital admissions process, he decided to lend a
                            hand by building an admissions system using low-code tools with limited
                            costs. He joins us to talk about this project and how other developers
                            can provide impactful tech while cutting time and costs.
