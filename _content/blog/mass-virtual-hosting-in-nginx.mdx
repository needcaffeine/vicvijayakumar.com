I actually forgot to publish this blog post, but since I seem to get a lot of traffic to my post about [mass virtual hosting with Apache](/blog/mass-virtual-hosting-in-apache), I feel like I should probably write this simply for the sake of completeness, even though it's brutally simple.

If you need a place to start with nginx, I am a fan of the [H5BP configs](https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs-nginx).

All the mass virtual hosting magic here happens when we get to an individual site.

    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name *.example.com;
        root /wwwroot/vhosts/$host;

        [...]
    }

That's really all there is to it. You can now create all sorts of crazy directories in your `/wwwroot/vhosts/` directory and they'll get served.

1.example.com  
1.2.example.com
etc.

Reload nginx. Profit.
